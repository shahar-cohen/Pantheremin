## A musical experience like no other

A combination of pantam fingerdrumming and theremin proximity-based playing, the PanTheremin is the perfect tool for people of all ages. Some knowledge in fabrication, 3D design, arduino, electrical engineering, sound design, programming and music theory might be needed for construction.

### Design

Parametric pattern design, created using Grasshopper on Rhino. The algorithmically generated triangle pattern creates a spacey feeling fitting the playing experience we wanted to convey.

### Communications

Using arduino, we converted the signal from the proximity IR sensors into MIDI messages. Those were channelled to Ableton Live for producing actual sounds, designed by us from available plugins.
The MIDI messages were also used to create a OSC message signal, which was sent to the visualization monitor, influencing the speed and color of the waves presented on it.

### Fun

Yes, it is very fun.
